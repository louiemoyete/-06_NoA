			Notes : 
		Unique ID works for everything except Aragorn's. 
		The reason for this that the unique IDs in the data provided inside the category 'Combos' range from 5 to 11 but skip number 9. 
		So, when summing up all the digits, the first added item will repeat ID 14. 
		After that first one, the rest will continue to be unique. 
		Regardless, everywhere else, they are unique still. 

		Also, the button ' save changes ' to work, 
			the button ' Add category ' and ' Add item ' must be clicked first. Either one, or both, depending on what you want to add to the menu. 

		As well, more the one item can be added at the same time. I just forgot to reset the textboxes after the add button is clicked. 


		Aside from that, it's pretty straight forward. 

			Thank you, and good night.
